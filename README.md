# Natural Disasters Track: Earthquake Protection Bed

This repository contains the files used in our Earthquake Protection Bed. We've used a GY-61 Gyroscope Sensor to get the data of the tremors and it is being tracked in real time using Processing, which is a Java-based Framework. A dataset of this data is also generated, which is then uploaded on IBM Cognos Analytics, for further analysis.
